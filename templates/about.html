        <h2>Welcome to Our Website</h2>
        <p>
            This website is designed to help identify diseases in different parts of a cotton plant, including leaves, stems, and buds. 
            Using cutting-edge machine learning models, we aim to provide accurate and efficient predictions to support farmers and agricultural enthusiasts in diagnosing plant health issues.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Our mission is to empower farmers with advanced technology to reduce crop losses and promote sustainable farming practices.
            By leveraging artificial intelligence, we strive to make disease diagnosis faster, more accessible, and highly reliable.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Background</h2>
        <p>
            We are final-year B.Tech students who developed this project as part of our academic curriculum. We chose this project 
            because we believe it can make a difference to farmers, who are the backbone of our country. 
            Even if it helps them in a tiny way, our efforts will be worthwhile.
        </p>
        <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
        <p>We are:</p>
        <ul class="team-list">
            <li>Sonali</li>
            <li>Abhishek</li>

            <li>Rutwik</li>
            <li>Pujita</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            1. Choose the plant part (Leaf, Stem, or Bud).<br>
            2. Upload an image of the selected part.<br>
            3. Get instant predictions about the possible disease and take necessary actions!
